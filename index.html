<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Phillip Island, which is located in Victoria, is a popular tourist destination that has welcomed over 1,000,000 visitors yearly, 56% of which are from overseas
<a href="#ref1">[1]</a>. Because of this, much of the island's economy revolves around tourism. There are many attractions and accommodations meant to entertain and educate tourists. Phillip Island has been declared an "advanced ecotourism destination", which includes an emphasis on nature, sustainability, environmental conservation, customer satisfaction and cultural understanding. The aim of this fieldwork is to investigate and compare the focus on customer satisfaction, customer safety and co-operation with local communities at the sites at Phillip Island. It will investigate to what degree San Remo, Koala Conservation Center, The Nobbies and the Penguin Reserve ensure safety and satisfaction for the tourists and local communities. Based on the rating given by NEAP it is hypothesised that the attractions at Phillip Island employ a wide variety of management techniques that result in high customer satisfaction, as well as a positive effect on the local communities.

<p>Phillip Island is located in Victoria, Australia. It is 125 km south-southeast of Melbourne. The four study sites are San Remo, the Koala Conservation Center, the Nobbies and the Penguin Reserve. San Remo is located on the east of the island. The Koala Conservation Center is on the east of the main island. The Nobbies is on the west side of the island, and the Penguin Reserve is located right next to the Nobbies, to its right. Phillip Island has a mean daily maximum temperature of 24 degrees Celsius and a minimum of 14 degrees Celsius, and the mean monthly rainfall varies from 30 mm to 80 mm throughout the year. Phillip Island is 23 km long and 10 km wide. <a href="ref2">[2]</a></p>

<p>
The Yalloc Bulluk clan were the first inhabitants of Phillip Island, which was known as "Corriong" or "Millowl". In 1798, Europeans began settling in Phillip Island. Through 1985 to 2010, a buy-back program was employed. In 2014 and 2015, Phillip Island Nature Parks was awarded the international Green Flag Award, for its high quality management of tourists and attractions. Currently it is still being employed as a popular tourist destination.</p>

<h2>Method</h2>
<p>For each site, the following information will be collected. In bold is the data that will be highly relevant to the research question.</p>
<ul>
<li>A list of natural features and human features found at the site</li>
<li>Three to five management techniques from each site, its intended purpose and effectiveness</li>
<li><b>Measurement of the noise level</b> at each site (to be compared with the suggested level)</li>
<li>A scale from little significance to big significance on four aspects- evidence of human impact, <b>litter</b>, density of vegetation and evidence of management (litter will be relevant to study).</li>
<li>A series of questions on how an aspect of the site is managed as a resource, <b>how are the tourists managed</b>, and what educational/ecotourism does the site serve.</li>
<li>A table of criteria will be checked out- Natural area focus, interpretation, environmental sustainability, contribution to conservation, <b>collaborating with communities, cultural component, customer satisfaction, responsible marketing.</b></li>
<li><b>Evaluation</b> on whether this site would receive an Ecotourism accreditation rating (with focus on customer satisfaction).</li>
<li>An annotated sketch map of the site. </li>
<li>Photos that illustrate the data collected.</li>
</ul>
